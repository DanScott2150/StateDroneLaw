# StateDroneLaw.com
Live website running on WordPress, receiving approximately 10k pageviews per month. Features a custom theme that was built from scratch, as well as custom-coded post types and taxonomies. Integrates with an auto-updater app (separate GitHub repo) to help automate the process of keeping the site's content up to date.

### Tech Used:
    - WordPress
    - PHP
    - CSS & SASS
    - WAMP Server & Gulp (for local development)

### Setup
StateDroneLaw custom theme: wp-content/themes/Statedronelaw/
Custom post types & taxonomies: wp-content/plugins/SDL-taxonomies.php

### Background
StateDroneLaw.com was my first "real" web development project idea. This was developed as I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as taking a handful of Lynda.com courses relating to WordPress development. WordPress's default posts/pages functionality didn't fully support what I was trying to accomplish, so I created my own custom-coded theme and post type taxonomies.

### Current Functionality
Live site: https://statedronelaw.com
